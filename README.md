# EasterTracker Application

This is our group's project 2 of COMP90018 in 2020 S2.

## Introduction
This is a geographic location-based social application. Friends can bury each other's easter eggs and share fun and interesting things about their geographic location in real time. This app is designed to appeal to users to go out and see more interesting things in the city, while also promoting friendship between friends.

## Project Structure

For the purpose of flexible development, we adopt the mode of webapp + webview to implement our application. 

The frontend handles the display of UI and map and data's rendering. The backend handles data processing and storage. 

Also, the frontend and the backend in our webapp are independent. This seperation makes the frontend and the backend of our application can be developed simultaneously which saves a lot of time.

After importing the webapp into webview, native Android API are uitilised to request permissions in order to make the webapp enable to access multiple sensors of system such as GPS, microphone, camera, etc.
